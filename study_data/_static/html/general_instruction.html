            <p>It is December 31, 2023. You are an investor interested in purchasing individual stocks. You understand and accept the risks involved, and you’ve come to consult a financial advisor for guidance on which individual stocks might suit your needs.</p>
        
            <p>In this experiment, you will be presented with one stock per round over five rounds (a total of five stocks). For each stock, engage with the financial advisor to determine whether the stock is suitable for your needs or not. If you come across unfamiliar financial concepts or don’t fully understand what the financial advisor says, <strong>feel free to ask questions for clarification</strong>.</p>

            Once <strong>you feel that you have gathered enough information to make a financial decision, you can move on to the evaluation phase</strong>.
        
            <!-- <p>If you don’t have a strong preference about certain characteristics of the stock, <span style="background-color: yellow;">you may simply state, “I don’t have a preference on this dimension.”</span></p> -->
            <p>To interact with the financial advisor, first push the <strong>Start Conversation</strong> button. Then, type your message in the <strong>User Input</strong> textbox and press the <strong>Send This Message to Advisor</strong> button. If the response from the financial advisor is cut off due to word limitations, press the <strong>Show More of the Advisor’s Answer</strong> button to have the advisor continue the conversation. If you already have enough information to make a decision, you don’t need to press the <strong>Show More of the Advisor’s Answer</strong> button.</p>
